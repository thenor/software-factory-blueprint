Using the SDK to cross compile
==============================

Cross compiling with the help of the SDK is not much different from normal compilation. There are
some more pitfalls, but let us get on with the happy cases for now.

.. _sourcing-the-environment:

Sourcing The Environment
------------------------

After the installation the SDK it needs to be sourced. This means that the SDK toolchain and the
sysroot environment variables will be set in your active terminal session.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/sdk
    source environment-setup-<arch>-poky-linux

To check if the environment has already been sourced grep for variables which start with `OECORE` in
the environment for example like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    env | grep OECORE
    OECORE_DISTRO_VERSION=2.2.1
    OECORE_SDK_VERSION=2.2.1


This means that the environment has been sourced.

Cross Compiling
---------------

In the easiest case, when all the projects dependencies are already installed in the SDK,
cross-compiling is really easy. Navigate in to the directory and use cmake and make to compile it as
you normally would. The environment will make sure that the right compiler and cmake will be used.

In the case of additional external dependencies, it is recommended to install them into the SDK so
that they can be found by tools like ``pkg-config``. The ``cmake`` tool provided with the SDK does
that by default, so when building a shared library using ``cmake`` one would typically issue
these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install  # prefix with sudo, if the SDK sysroot is not user-writable

and the library would be immediately usable by all applications building on the SDK.

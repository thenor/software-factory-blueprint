    With Yocto, one can create a Software Development Kit (SDK), for quick and easy development of
    software components that works well with the target system.

.. _installing-sdk:

Installing the SDK
------------------

The SDK file is not executable by default. This needs to be changed with ``chmod``. If you
downloaded the SDK from the Internet, the ``<SDK location>`` is typically ``~/Downloads``. If
you built the SDK from the build directory, it can be found on ``tmp/deploy/sdk``.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <SDK location>
    chmod +x pelux-glibc-x86_64-<image-name>-<arch>-toolchain-<version>.sh

It is a self extracting shell script which can be executed. This will start an interactive program
which first asks where to install the SDK. The easiest way is to install it in your ``home``
directory in its own directory, like ``~/sdk``, instead of the default which is ``/opt``. ``/opt``
is most probably not prepared for your user to install anything into.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    âžœ jdoe@tux Downloads ./pelux-glibc-x86_64-core-image-pelux-minimal-cortexa7hf-neon-vfpv4-toolchain-1.0.sh
    PELUX (Built on Yocto 1.0) SDK installer version 1.0
    ====================================================
    Enter target directory for SDK (default: /opt/pelux-sdk-x86_64/1.0):
    You are about to install the SDK to "/opt/pelux-sdk-x86_64/1.0". Proceed[Y/n]? Y
    Extracting SDK.............done
    Setting it up...done
    SDK has been successfully set up and is ready to be used.

Now the SDK is installed and can be used.
